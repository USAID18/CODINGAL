        To speak with computers, programmers learn different <code id="q1">coding languages</code>. Binary code is the
        primary language of all computers. Binary code consists of only two numbers: one and zero. In the binary coding
        language, zero represents off while one represents on.

        Binary is still used with electronics and computer hardware. Programmers can use binary to control the flow of
        electricity and the positive and negative poles of a magnet. Binary code allows programmers to create simple
